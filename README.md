# cloud-security-labs
Hands-on AWS Cloud Security portfolio labs demonstrating detection, prevention and remediation of common cloud security risks
# Cloud Security Portfolio (AWS)

📍 Based in Norway — targeting junior / trainee cloud security roles.

This repo contains 10 hands-on AWS security labs where I intentionally create real misconfigurations / insecure scenarios, then detect and remediate them using AWS native security services.

I built these labs so I can demonstrate **actual competency**, not just course study.

Hiring philosophy in Nordics is skills-first → so this is my practical evidence.

## Why I built this

I believe a junior cloud security engineer should be able to:

- create a dangerous misconfiguration (like attackers exploit)
- detect it using the correct AWS security service
- fix it using best practice

This repo shows that I can do that.

## My current direction

- building AWS security muscle
- preparing for AWS Security Specialty (long term)
- growing in threat detection, incident response & cloud misconfig analysis
